> The following CV has been prepared at the request of a discerning party who said, "Write a full CV using predominantly simple past and present perfect tense to describe responsibilities, accomplishments, and ongoing experiences. Use the simple past tense for completed actions or specific tasks in their previous roles, and utilise the present perfect tense for ongoing responsibilities and experiences." In other words, blame them if this feels grammatically meticulous and strangely tense-focused.

## Profile

I have worked as a product designer and engineer for more than ten years, leading efforts on digital services, enterprise-level design systems, and complex user experiences. Over this period, I have guided cross-disciplinary teams, integrated human-centred design principles, and introduced emerging technologies, including careful use of AI-driven tools (no, not the kind that immediately becomes a rogue superintelligence). While I have gradually moved from hands-on execution to strategic oversight, I have always maintained a strong focus on knowledge sharing and practical outcomes.
