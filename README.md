## Profile

I have worked as a product designer and engineer for more than ten years, leading efforts on digital services, enterprise-level design systems, and complex user experiences. Over this period, I have guided cross-disciplinary teams, integrated human-centred design principles, and introduced emerging technologies, including careful use of AI-driven tools and avoiding rogue superintelligences. While I have gradually moved from hands-on execution to strategic oversight, I have always maintained a strong focus on knowledge sharing and practical outcomes.
